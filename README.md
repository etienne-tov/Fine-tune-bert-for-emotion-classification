# Emotion Classification with Fine-tuned BERT

## Overview

This project involves fine-tuning the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for emotion classification. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the emotion conveyed in text, specifically focusing on the emotions of joy, fear, and anger.
